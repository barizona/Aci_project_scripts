#xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


# Description: 
# Area under the bacterial growth curves either in the absence
# (untreated) or in the presence of different phages alone or in combinations.
# Data points represent the mean area under the bacterial growth curve value of
# three technical replicates measured with each ST2-KL3 CRAB clinical isolates
# (n = 41 distinct isolates, except for the 3-phage combinations, where n = 27).
# A.u stands for the arbitrary unit. ** p ⋜ 0.05, *** p = 0.0001, **** p <
# 0.0001 from two-sided Kruskal-Wallis test. Abbreviations: H – Highwayman, S –
# Silvergun, F – Fanak, Po – Porter, N - Navy-v2, Ph – PhT2-v2.
